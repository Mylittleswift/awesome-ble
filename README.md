## Library
_If you are planning to integrate BLE in your project, here you can find a list of useful libraries for mobile, eps32, rpi and much more._


### Android
_Android related resources._

- [RxAndroidBle](https://github.com/dariuszseweryn/RxAndroidBle) - An Android Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Library with RxJava3 interface.
- [SmartGattLib](https://github.com/movisens/SmartGattLib) - SmartGattLib is a Java library that simplifies the work with Bluetooth SMART devices (a.k.a. Bluetooth Low Energy in Bluetooth 4.0). It provides all UUIDs of the adopted GATT specification and an convenient way to interpret the characteristics (e.g. Heart Rate, BatteryLevel).

### ESP32
_ESP32 libraries._


### Flutter
_Flutter related resources._

- [Flutter Blue Plus](https://github.com/boskokg/flutter_blue_plus) - Flutter Blue Plus is a bluetooth plugin for Flutter, a new app SDK to help developers build modern multi-platform apps.
- [Flutter Reactive BLE](https://github.com/PhilipsHue/flutter_reactive_ble) - Flutter Reactive BLE is a Flutter library that handles BLE operations for multiple devices.

### iOS
_iOS related resources._

- [AsyncBluetooth](https://github.com/manolofdez/AsyncBluetooth) - A small library that adds concurrency to CoreBluetooth APIs.
- [CombineCoreBluetooth](https://github.com/StarryInternet/CombineCoreBluetooth) - CombineCoreBluetooth is a library that bridges Apple's CoreBluetooth framework and Apple's Combine framework.
- [iOS DFU Library](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/IOS-DFU-Library) - DFU application allows to flash new firmware on the DK.
- [Rx Bluetooth Kit](https://github.com/Polidea/RxBluetoothKit) - RxBluetoothKit is a Bluetooth library that makes interaction with BLE devices much more pleasant. It's backed by RxSwift and CoreBluetooth and it provides nice API, for both Central and Peripheral modes.
- [Swifty Sensors](https://github.com/codeinversion/sensors-swift) - Bluetooth LE Sensor Manager for iOS and macOS.

### KMM
_Kotlin Multiplaform Mobile (KMM) related resources._

- [BlueFalcon](https://github.com/Reedyuk/blue-falcon) - A Bluetooth kotlin multiplatform "Cross-Platform" library for iOS and Android.
- [Kable](https://github.com/JuulLabs/kable) - Kotlin Asynchronous Bluetooth Low Energy provides a simple Coroutines-powered API for interacting with Bluetooth Low Energy devices.

### RPi
_Raspberry Pi (RPi) libraries._
